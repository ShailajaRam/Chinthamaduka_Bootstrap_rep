  <h3>Yeh Rishta show favorite part </h3>
  <p class="jumbotron">Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai is the story of a young couple who live in a Marwari joint family in Udaipur. The story showcases their journey as a married couple going through adjustment issues, as parents of young children, and how they learn to love each other and their respective extended families while becoming mature members of their household.</p>
  <p>The show focuses on teenage Naira, who flees from her house and now lives in Rishikesh, nursing hatred for her mother. After finding Naira, the story takes a new twist: a love triangle that forms between Kartik (Naitik's employee), Naira and Gayu (Naitik's niece). Naira and Kartik have feelings for each other but don't know that it's love. Meanwhile Gayu loves Kartik, unaware that Kartik doesn't love her back. When Kartik proposes Naira, she initially rejects him, but by the time she realizes that Gayu also loves him, she thinks of sacrificing her happiness in favor of Gayu. When Mishti reveals that Kartik loves only Naira, Kartik and Naira confess their love for each other; Gayatri understands. Kartik doesn't want to talk about his family as he hates them. Meanwhile, on Akshara's birthday, everyone goes for a veneration, but Akshara dies in a car accident. Singhanias blame Kartik for Akshara's death as Kartik was found drunk and injured at the accident site. Kartik's family shows up and supports Kartik. Later, Naira finds that Kartik is not the culprit. She proves Kartik's innocence by finding the real culprit. Kartik doesn't like his father and stepmother as he thinks they were responsible for his mother's death. Seeing Kartik's feelings towards a Singhanias, his family approves of their relationship in spite of not being much in favor of it.
 </p>
 <p> The two families start making preparations for their wedding. Naira unexpectedly enters the Goenka house during the Tilak ceremony (which is considered to be unlucky before the wedding); Karthik's grandmother demands Naira's name to be changed as a solution. Just before the wedding, Kartik discovers the real culprit who ran Akshara over and yearns to tell Naira, but his uncle convinces him that he will tell her. He reneges and tells Naira only that Kartik is missing his mother. Finally, the wedding takes place. Currently the series is about the situations following the wedding. Just one day after the wedding, Kartik finds out about the promise Naira made to Suwarna before the wedding that she would try to convince Kartik to stay in the Goenka house forever. He immediately leaves with Naira to stay in a separate flat; Naira is not happy about it. Naira is injured by robbers, causing them to move back to the Goenka home. Naira meets the man whose brother is in jail for killing her mother and learns that Akshara's accident was caused by Mansi, Karthik's sister. The news reaches the Singhanias and they are heartbroken. The Goenkas come to apologize. Naira is initially very hurt and angry with Karthik, but she understands that it's not his fault. She takes Akshara's accident case back and forgives Mansi. On Karthik's birthday, he comes to know that Aditya tortures Keerthi and, along with Naira, decides to expose him. </p>
